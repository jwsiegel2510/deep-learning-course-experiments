# Experiments and sample codes from Math 649 (Foundations of Deep Learning) at Texas A&M University

A variety of sample codes and experiments used to teach the course Math 649 (Foundations of Deep Learning) at Texas A&M University. 
This includes basic examples of function fitting using neural networks, image classification, generative modelling, physics-informed neural networks, and operator learning.

### Basic Examples

Contained in the folder *basic-examples*. Consists of one experiment fitting a sin function using a amultilayer perceptron (MLP) and gradient descent on the squared error loss.

### Image Classification

Contained in the folder *image-classification*. Consists of two experiments, the first trains an MLP and the second trains a CNN to classify MNIST. The MLP training is done using vanilla gradient descent,
while the CNN training is done using gradient descent with momentum.
